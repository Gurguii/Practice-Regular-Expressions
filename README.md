# Quick use  
# Download the repository  
sudo git clone https://github.com/Gurguii/Practice-Regular-Expressions  

# Get into downloaded directory  
cd Practice-Regular-Expressions  

# Execute regex.sh with the downloaded rules (re_rules)
Example => bash regex.sh re_rules  
Note: As you might notice it takes a file as its only argument, feel free to use your own regex files. As long as it's 1 rule per line, everything should be fine.

Whenever you are saving a file, if it is an existing file, the script will let you choose between appending new mistakes to that given file or just giving a different filename.  
Filename could be a file in our current working directory or an absolute path.
