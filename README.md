## How it looks

## Extra info

- Inside the script the user has few options: change, save, exit. The save option will save current session's mistakes and write it to given <file/filepath>. In case the file already exists, user can  abort the operation or append new failed rules to the existing file (no reps).
- If someone ever reads this, feel free to give your regex ideas or even your own file so we can make a great list.
